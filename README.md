:wave: Hi, I'm Todd. I'm not a great developer, but I love to tinker with code and build things on the web. A _real_ developer probably wouldn't consider me a "developer", so I guess you could say that I am like the guy who can fix things in a house for a living but not someone you would hire to build the Taj Mahal. Outside of building something architecturally and technically spectacular like the Taj Mahal, I can probably earn a good living doing something I love. That's me.

I am interested in collaborative documentation and "learning to code" type things on the internet. This is why I built this (initially) not very great site to teach someone everything they might need to know about loops in JavaScript.

This project is an experiment to see what can be produced with some contributions from people in exchange for SATS. So, without further ado... here are the general categories and rewards to improving this site:

| Improvement Category | Reward | Description |
|----------------------|--------|-------------|
| Grammatical/Punctuation Error | FREE | Thank you for your generosity! It's probably too annoying for both of us to send like 500 SATS at a time for tiny little things. |
| New section or dedicated page | 125,000 SATS | A new section added to the page that teaches the user something new.
| Improvement to an existing section | 100,000 SATS | Make a meaningful improvement to an existing section. E.g. make it easier to understand with a revised example or more elaborate demo linked to a new page on this URL |
| Improve the functionality of the site | 75,000 SATS | This is a non-content related improvement that makes the site better in some way other than the content a user may learn from. |
| Include a relevant link to this site from another website | 50,000 SATS | Help us make the site more popular by linking to it and bringing in new traffic/links. Note: this one is probably the easiest to game, please don't be a jerk :) |

## How do I get my reward?

Pretty simple: submit a pull request. Once its accepted, you send me a lightning invoice (or BTC wallet address) and I send you the SATS corredponding with the type of improvement performed. If the improvement doesn't fit into a specifica category, we'll make a new one! The goal is to keep it fair and see what we can get done on a relatively small project before trying it on a larger one and in a more automated reward fashion.

## What are SATS?

The smallest unit of Bitcoin. You can get a rough idea of the USD value of each reward using this [sats to usd converter](http://satsto.cash/)

## Improving on what's already out there

Ideally, we will be able to collaboratively build something that is better than other tutorials, examples, and content that we can find via Google. For example, here are some sites that teach you different aspects of how to loop in JavaScript:

- WebReference [JavaScript For Loop](https://webreference.com/javascript/for-loop/) and [JavaScript forEach](https://webreference.com/javascript/array-methods/forEach/)

- MDN Web Docs [Loops and iteration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)

- W3Schools [JavaScript for loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)

Can we build something better? I'd like to think we can.
